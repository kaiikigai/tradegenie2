# Tradegenie2

Tradegenie2 is an AI trading copilot that scans markets and surfaces high probability setups for discretionary traders using the kai edition of the Merlin GTK tooling.

The repository keeps shared headers in include, native sources in src, executable artifacts in bin, and build outputs in build so each layer of the toolchain stays clear.

## Availability

A commercial build for Windows is available on sharepanda.org to support this work.
